“Who will you die for?”—This question inherently contains two subjects: “who” and “you.” It introduces an inquiry into the valuation between the individual (you) and the other (who). The word “die” implies an extreme standard of measurement: the value of life itself. Ultimately, the question ends with a reason, guiding us to ponder: under what circumstances would one place their life on the scales of judgment? This is not merely an ethical choice but a profound metaphysical paradox.

Can human rationality truly transcend individual existence, surpass life itself to evaluate the value of life? If it can, then what does sacrificing one’s life truly signify? Does the value of life change as a result? If rationality has boundaries, is the value of life precisely situated at that boundary? Is this akin to what Camus described as “the fate of Sisyphus,” who, in the endless task of pushing the boulder uphill, continually assigns new value and meaning to his life and existence? Would a person ever sacrifice their life for something beyond their own inherent value, for another individual or a particular ideology?

This line of questioning leads us to a more fundamental issue: Can the meaning of an individual’s life truly be weighed against the significance of another’s value?

From the perspective of Foucault’s biopolitics, where “society must be defended,” the value of individual life is not determined by the individual themselves. In a society where each person is reduced to a calculable entity, divided and categorized, individuals have no say over the disposition of their bodies. In this system, where the physical body is disciplined, and knowledge and existence are medicalized and technologized, human life serves as the foundation for maintaining the operational structure. The system requires individuals to generate value and meaning, just as individuals depend on life technologies and infrastructures. In this mutually reinforcing dynamic, we must examine what Foucault’s theory reveals about society: whose lives are sacrificed, and why? What forms does death take in this context? Here, a clarification is necessary: does death merely signify the cessation of the body, or does it represent a surrender of the rights over life and death? Why do we voluntarily relinquish our right to life? Do we genuinely have a choice? Evidently, within the institutionalized system of life management, individuals lack the right to end their own lives. We, seeking a better life, deliberately place marginalized groups—those outside societal norms—on a balance of value conversion. On one side are the lives of the weak; on the other, the interests of everyone within the system. The standard for weighing these interests is adjusted through big data, algorithms, and contemporary scientific assessments. Moral decisions are entirely dictated by the classifications and quotas determined by system designers, as well as the allocation of life-sustaining resources. Here, life becomes a consumable, a lower-value breathing and eating machine.

Incorporating oneself into this life valuation system, the daily reality of being categorized and managed equates to the exchange of one’s right to life and death.

This system emphasizes the present moment, anchoring life’s progress to the scientific standard of clock time.

So, “Who will I die for?” Within a framework of time measured by hours, minutes, and seconds, we seem to be continually contributing our lives to the system’s operation. Sustaining life is a means of preserving labor capacity, a necessity for the system’s function and better management. Surrendering the meaning and value of life, transferring the significance of one’s actions to others, resembles a form of chronic death in contemporary society. We yield our life resources to unseen others, contributing our existence and the meaning of our data to an invisible algorithmic system. The value of life transforms into coordinates on a statistical graph; the meaning of living is reduced to the production of data.

This discussion appears to address “Who am I dying for?”, rather than who I will die for. But considering the reality is always worthwhile. We already understand that the unification of life time equates to the unification of life value. The delegation of life’s meaning and value is equivalent to surrendering life itself. Death is not an outcome but a gradual process. Therefore, for the individual, does the transferred meaning and value of life offer an understanding of death that transcends the value inherent in the individual’s own life? Sisyphus refuses to relinquish control over his life; he retains the right to define its value. Eternal time symbolizes the absence of death. For us, however, death is an ambiguous point; we do not know when, where, or how we will die. Sustaining life and death are two sides of the same coin, together generating human significance. To die for someone is to disrupt or extend the value of life beyond its temporal dimension. The meaning of life becomes directed toward an object and expands as the moment of death approaches.

This implies that when I decide to give my life for someone or something, the object of my sacrifice also bears the weight of this death. The power of life is transferred onto the value of their existence, amplifying their life while mine dissolves into a symbol of death, representing something greater than human life itself. This is beyond rational explanation: the individual loses sovereignty over their life in the moment of death but simultaneously endows the other with a value that transcends the individual. This choice goes beyond rational calculation, entering the realm of ethics and metaphysics.

We have considered the system and the other, but what if the “who” is ourselves? What does this kind of self-sacrifice imply? Is it universal? The question becomes, “Will you die for yourself?” In this case, the subject of life’s valuation shifts to every individual. If we use a model to illustrate this, Schrödinger’s cat serves as a fitting metaphor. When faced with this question, death is not a fact but a hypothetical state yet to arrive. Life and death coexist in uncertainty. The individual is the observer outside the box. Yet, when the individual is placed into the framework of life valuation, they become the cat inside the box, uncertain of their fate. The individual has the authority to press the button, choosing to die for themselves; they are both alive and dead, observer and subject. From a rational perspective, a living individual cannot perceive their own bodily decay or the cessation of consciousness. The observer cannot determine the life or death state of the cat in the box. But the cat can. In this experiment, the assumptions about the cat may differ from those about humans. Schrödinger assumed that the observer cannot comprehend or predict the cat’s behavior due to an insurmountable behavioral gap. The cat’s curiosity and uncertainty could lead to its survival or death. In the context of biopolitics, the individual seemingly has no power to choose the box they inhabit. The box is adjusted based on different types, genders, and appearances, affecting its size and the provision of sustenance. Let’s not forget, before the decision to press the button is made, the clock inside the box continues to tick. The individual as observer and the cat within the box coexist within the same questioner’s identity. The observer does not know the choice inside the box, and the individual within the box does not know what the observer sees. The individual exists in a paradox of both wishing to live and wishing to die. The choice of life may be in a state of superposition. Pondering this question expands the consideration of self-life valuation from the observer’s perspective. The observer, being purely rational, cannot comprehend their own internal deliberations within the box.
